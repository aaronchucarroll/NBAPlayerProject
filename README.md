Runs five different analysis models to determine where in the draft order an NBA player was selected based on their lifetime statistics.

The five models used are:
1. Linear Regression
2. Decision Tree
3. k-Nearest Neighbor
4. Naïve-Bayes
5. Logistic Regression

The best approach is a Naïve-Bayes model, which correctly sorts NBA players into their correct statistical "bin", or range of draft picks, 56% of the time.
